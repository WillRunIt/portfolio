        <p>Hi there! I am Willem De Kerpel, a 26 year old junior Python developer. I have started my Python journey at the start of 2024 by following the Beetroot international course on Python programming. This opened up a whole new world to me.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to enjoy gaming with my friends and going on road trips together with my girlfriend. I used to also work with Photoshop quite a lot in the past, but due to time restraints, I have let go of this. I hope to pick this back up in the future.</p>
        <p>My future goals currently consist of getting better at Python programming and most likely also learning a few new languages. I would love to become a full-stack developer over time.</p>
